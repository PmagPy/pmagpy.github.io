{"name":"PmagPy","tagline":" An open source project for the analysis of paleomagnetic data","body":"**PmagPy** is a set of tools written in Python for the analysis of paleomagnetic data. It facilitates interpretation of demagnetization data, Thellier-type paleointensity data and data from other types of rock magnetic experiments. PmagPy can be used to create a wide variety of useful plots. It is designed to work with the MagIC database (https://earthref.org/MagIC), allowing manipulation of downloaded data sets as well as preparation of new contributions for uploading to the MagIC database. It also supports the use of IPython/Jupyter notebooks for fully documented and nicely illustrated data analysis.\r\n\r\nThe [PmagPy Cookbook](http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook) is the place to go for detailed information on the installation and use of PmagPy programs.\r\n\r\n### PmagPy Executable Applications\r\nGraphical user interface (GUI) programs for getting data into the MagIC database format, analyzing demagnetization data and analyzing paleointensity data are availible for download as single executable applications:\r\n\r\n[Mac OSX PmagPy App](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest)\r\n\r\n[Windows PmagPy App](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-Windows/releases/latest)\r\n\r\n### All of PmagPy\r\nIn addition to the GUI programs, PmagPy is comprised of:\r\n  - Command line programs for all sorts of paleomagnetic data analysis and wrangling (contained within the programs folder of the main PmagPy repository).\r\n  - The pmagpy function module for paleomagnetic data analysis (pmagpy.pmag) and plotting (pmagpy.pmagplotlib) as well as a function module that further enables paleomagnetic data analysis within interactive computing environments such as the Jupyter notebook (pmagpy.ipmag). The functions within these modules are at the heart of the GUI and command line programs. With pmagpy in the python path (which is accomplished with the install scripts), these modules are can be imported (e.g. ```import pmagpy.ipmag as ipmag```).\r\n  - Example data files that are used in the examples provided in the PmagPy cookbook http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook\r\n  \r\nUse of all these features is described in the cookbook and the underlying science behind the data and code can be explored in the book Essentials of Paleomagnetism: Third Web Edition (http://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/).\r\n\r\n### How to use PmagPy \r\n\r\nFull documentation for PmagPy installation and use is available in the [PmagPy cookbook](http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook). You can see examples of PmagPy in action within these Jupyter notebooks: [Example PmagPy Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PmagPy/2016_Tauxe-et-al_PmagPy_Notebooks/blob/master/Example_PmagPy_Notebook.ipynb) [Additional PmagPy Examples](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PmagPy/2016_Tauxe-et-al_PmagPy_Notebooks/blob/master/Additional_PmagPy_Examples.ipynb). The notebooks themselves can be found in this repository: https://github.com/PmagPy/2016_Tauxe-et-al_PmagPy_Notebooks/\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use all of PmagPy (including functionality that extends well beyond what is available in the executable applications), here is how to get started:\r\n- download a zip file of the latest release here: [PmagPy latest release](https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy/releases/latest). Click on \"Source code (zip)\" or \"Source code (tar.gz)\" to download. \r\n- To install the software on a Mac or a PC, unzip the downloaded folder and double-click on the install script for your system. \r\n- Linux and advanced users on Mac and PCs can either clone the repository or download the latest release and then add the directory of the main repository folder (and the program directory for access to the command line programs) to their path and pythonpath. On a Mac, this can be done by adding these lines to the bash_profile: \r\n    \r\n    - ```export PATH=~/PmagPy:./:$PATH```\r\n\r\n    - ```export PATH=~/PmagPy/programs:./:$PATH```\r\n\r\n    - ```export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/PmagPy```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe code base for the PmagPy project has been built up over many years by Lisa Tauxe (@ltauxe; Distinguished Professor of Geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography) supported by grants from the National Science Foundation. Ron Shaar (@ronshaar, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem), Lori Jonestrask (@moonshoes87) and Nick Swanson-Hysell (@swanson-hysell; Assistant Professor at UC Berkeley) have also made substantial contributions to the project. You too can become a contributor by forking a repository and putting in a pull request. \r\n\r\n### Bug reports\r\nProblems with the software can be reported as issues at this page: [PmagPy Issues](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
