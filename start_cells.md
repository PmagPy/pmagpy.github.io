# PmagPy Jupyter Notebook Version

by Lisa Tauxe, Lori Jonestrask, Nick Swanson-Hysell and Nick Jarboe

### What is **PmagPy**?

**PmagPy** is a software package for analyzing paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data using Python. If you need to install Python and PmagPy locally, follow the [install instructions](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#getting_python). This notebook demonstrates the use of **PmagPy** functions from within a  Jupyter notebook. For examples of how to use PmagPy scripts on the command line, see the static version of [**PmagPy\_cli.ipynb**](http://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-cli.html) or if you are running jupyter notebook, you can open it locally (see instructions below).


### What are paleomagnetism and rock magnetism?

For information on the science of paleomagnetism and rock magnetism, see [Essentials of Paleomagnetism](https://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/).


### Using Jupyter notebooks for Earth Science

If you already have some experience working with Python, you should be able to use this notebook without difficulty.

If not, we have a full course in [Python for Earth Scientists](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ltauxe/Python-for-Earth-Science-Students/blob/master/Lecture_01.ipynb) available on Github.


### Running this notebook

You are currently looking at static html, but you may want to run this notebook interactively.  You can check out a [Binder demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PmagPy/PmagPy/master?filepath=PmagPy.ipynb)  of this notebook (please be patient, it loads very slowly).

You can also run this notebook locally. To do so, you'll need to first install Python and PmagPy (see [the Cookbook](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#getting_python) for install instructions).  You can then launch the notebook from your command line (see [more details here](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#notebook_quickstart)).
